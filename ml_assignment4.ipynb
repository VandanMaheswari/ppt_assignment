        "1.The purpose of the General Linear Model (GLM) is to analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables, while accounting for the effects of other covariates.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.The key assumptions of the GLM include linearity (the relationship between variables is linear), independence of errors (residuals are not correlated), homoscedasticity (constant variance of errors), and normality of errors (errors are normally distributed).\n",
        "\n",
        "3.In a GLM, coefficients represent the change in the dependent variable associated with a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, holding other variables constant. Positive coefficients indicate a positive relationship, negative coefficients indicate a negative relationship, and the magnitude of the coefficient indicates the strength of the relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.A univariate GLM involves analyzing the relationship between a single dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In contrast, a multivariate GLM involves analyzing the relationship between multiple dependent variables and multiple independent variables simultaneously.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.Interaction effects in a GLM occur when the relationship between an independent variable and the dependent variable depends on the value of another independent variable. It indicates that the effect of one predictor on the outcome varies based on the level of another predictor.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Categorical predictors in a GLM are typically handled by creating dummy variables. Each category of the categorical predictor is represented by a separate binary (0 or 1) variable, which allows the model to account for the effects of different categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.The design matrix in a GLM represents the arrangement of the independent variables, including any dummy variables, used in the model. It organizes the predictors into a matrix format that allows for efficient calculations and estimation of coefficients.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.The significance of predictors in a GLM can be tested using hypothesis tests, typically with a t-test or an F-test. These tests compare the estimated coefficient of the predictor to its standard error and assess whether the predictor has a statistically significant effect on the dependent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.Type I, Type II, and Type III sums of squares are different approaches to partitioning the variability in the dependent variable among the predictors in a GLM. Type I sums of squares consider the order of entry of predictors, Type II sums of squares assess the individual contribution of each predictor controlling for others, and Type III sums of squares evaluate the contribution of each predictor independent of the others.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.Deviance in a GLM is a measure of how well the model fits the data. It represents the difference between the observed data and the predicted values based on the model. Lower deviance indicates a better fit of the model to the data. Deviance is used in hypothesis testing and model comparison, such as in likelihood ratio tests.\n"

        "30.The main difference between squared loss and absolute loss is in the way they penalize prediction errors. Squared loss penalizes larger errors more severely due to the squaring operation, while absolute loss treats all errors equally by taking their absolute values. This difference influences the model's sensitivity to outliers."
